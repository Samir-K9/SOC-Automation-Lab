# SOC-Automation-Lab

## Objective
The SOC Automation Lab project has been crucial in strengthening my understanding of security operations and developing my skills as a security analyst. I focused on using this platform to build skills in automating security operations. Working with different security tools gave me hands-on experience that improved my technical knowledge and ability to speed up threat detection and response through automation. 

### Skills Learned
- Developed automation skills for security processes, boosting operational efficiency and reducing manual errors.
- Created custom scripts for threat detection, such as identifying and mitigating sophisticated tools like Mimikatz, enhancing SOC capabilities against advanced cybersecurity threats.
- Gained expertise in systematic incident logging, analysis, and management, ensuring organized, strategic responses to security events.
- Improved proficiency in using threat intelligence platforms for in-depth analysis, boosting alert accuracy and threat mitigation.
- Acquired hands-on experience in configuring and managing security infrastructure across various environments, including cloud platforms, to support SOC operations.
- Enhanced skills in integrating and managing different operating systems within the SOC, ensuring a robust and comprehensive security posture.

## Prerequisites
### Hardware Requirements
- A host machine with adequate CPU, RAM, and disk space to support the VMs and their anticipated workloads.

### Software Requirements
- **VMware:** A software platform used for creating and managing virtual machines.
- **Windows 10:** A client device used to simulate real-world security threats, allowing for the testing and fine-tuning of SOC automation workflows.
- **Ubuntu 22.04:** Linux distribution for deploying Wazuh and TheHive which will be hosted on the cloud.
- **Sysmon:** A Windows system service and device driver that provides detailed information about system activity.

### Tools and Platforms
